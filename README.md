# React-slideshow
Slideshow made in ReactJS for learning purposes

Basically whenever I learn a new React concept or have an idea how to solve a problem for creating the slideshow I'll write code here
I also will be testing some React things, whether they work or not depending on the problem
So, of course, due to the circumstances above the code won't be perfect
